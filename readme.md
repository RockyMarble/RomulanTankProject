# Tanks: a Romulans Production 
> Team comprised of Alexander Wilems, Nat Arney, Benjamin Marble, Adrian Lamphier

> This program is meant to be a local multiplayer 2D strategy and turn based tank arcade game. 
Our audience is ourselves and anyone else who may find this game fun.
 
> We made this game to get a better feel for the design side of programming, learning 2D game creation seems like something fun to learn for the group. We chose to do this over working on something more pragmatic, as the goal of this class is not to create something that will change the world, but learn tools such as Jira, Bitbucket, and learn how to communicate as a team while working remotely. We feel that the creation of just a code based program would not give us the challenge of communication in a way that a multimedia program such as a game would.

## Review

### Alexander Wilems

Sprint 3

Creation of Particle effects for lasers, assets for new weapons, bullet line basic set up and implementation. Focus on quality of life animations. Change of version number to indicate end of semester based development. 

* Accomplishment: Creation of animated health and fuel bars utilizing the same script template, allowing for reuse of code without copy, and giving the user a visual representation of what their health/fuel level is without trying to see a number that may be hard for those with accessibility needs to read without extra support. 
Link to git repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/HitPoints.gd)

Sprint 2

Creation of most animations, modifications of tanks to be symmetrical. Development of rudimentary points system, upscaling of map resolutions.

* Accomplishment: Modification of symmetrical tanks allowing for less awkward player controls. Link to git repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/images/Tanks/symTankGreen.png)

Sprint 1

Creating art and main menu for game. Backgrounds have been created, but not implemented yet. 

* Accomplishment: Creation of fully functioning Title Screen. creates a starting page for game, ability to exit if program was opened accidentally, and allows start of game. Link to git repository for Main Menu [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/scenes/TitleScreen.tscn).

### Nat Arney 

Sprint 3

* Accomplishment: Created and implemented powerups/items to allow for more dynamic gameplay. Link to git repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/Powerups.gd).

Sprint 2

Level cycling, endgame, fuel system, and tank interactions.

* Accomplishment: Created and implemented the level cycling in the Tank Game. When one level ends, the game cycles to the next in line (Level 1 to Level 2, 3, 4...) until there are no more levels to cycle through, at which point the game ends. [Link to code](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/World.gd).

Sprint 1

Creation of basic terrain hit-boxes, health functions of tanks, and damage functions for the game, and in game pause menu. Most functions created are currently implemented in game. 

* Accomplishment: Creation of health and damage mechanics for the tanks and projectiles. Creation of these allows for there to be a goal that can be accomplished in the game of dispatching your opponent with the use of projectiles, and allows the game to have somewhat of an ending. Repository link to code can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/TankRigid.gd). *(Please note, while health can run out in game, and player is dusted once dead, there is not yet an end of game mechanic for when only 1 player is left standing, to be added in next sprint.)*

### Benjamin Marble 

Sprint 3

Implementation of a music changer that advances the level music to the next track when switching to the next level. Creation of a credits screen. Creation of sound effects for additional weapons and menu buttons, as well as additional music tracks. Cleaned some clutter in the repository.

* Accomplishment: Implementation of the credits screen. Created a new "credits" scene and linked it to a new "credits" button that is now found on the title screen. Utilized borrowed code(credited below) to soup-it-up and give it features such as holding the down arrow key to fast-forward and hitting escape to return to the title screen. Heavy edits were made to help with spacing and music synchronization, the music track finishes as the credits naturally scroll to the end. Created music for credits was re-assigned as a level track due to a shorter run time, resulting in all Rocky level music (pun intended) and Adrian's groovy tracks being featured in the credits and title screens. Links to [CreditsScript](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/Credits.gd), [CreditsButton](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/CreditsButton.gd), and [CreditsScene.](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/scenes/Credits.tscn)

Sprint 2

Sounds for new weapons, weapon projectile/sub-projectile explosions, tank movement, and turret movement have been created and implemented into the game.

* Accomplishment: Implementation of unique sound effects for each tank weapon projectile and projectile explosion. Any weapon projectile that contacts a solid object will trigger the projectile's corresponding explosion sound effect. This makes the game feel more realistic since rounds now make a satisfying concussion upon impact. The cluster cannon shows off this feature, as it has additional explosions! [Repository audio](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/audio/) [Script for cluster explosions](Game/Script/clusterExplosion.gd) [Script for initial cluster impact "pop"](Game/Script/cluster.gd)

Sprint 1

Creation and implementation of music and sound effects. Menu and level music, as well as basic sound effects for explosions have been implemented into the game, as of Sprint 1.

* Accomplishment: Implementation of the sound effects for the tank weapon and for when a player takes damage. When a projectile is fired, the sound effect for the tank turret immediately plays. The explosive sound is supposed to give the player a sense of power when firing the tank turret, boosting immersion and enjoyment of the game. Repository link to main gun firing sound effect [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/PlayerController.gd). *(Please note this file has been worked on by multiple members for implementation of items only in the scope of support for that member.)*

### Adrian Lamphier

Sprint 3

* Accomplishment:
Created two music tracks, used in the [credits](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/audio/TankMusicCredits.ogg) and [title screen](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/audio/TankMusicTitleScreen.ogg).
Added two more [weapon types.](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/Gun.gd)

Sprint 2

Added a [function](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/TankRigid.gd) to keep track of which weapon is being used.
Added two new [weapon types.](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/Gun.gd)

* Accomplishment: Implementation of randomized bomb direction and momentum for the cluster cannon weapon. This prevents the possibility of the same cluster bomb spread pattern from repeating over and over, boosting realism and player immersion.

Sprint 1

Creating action groups such as shooting and movement for vehicles in-game. Also worked on slope movements, a mechanic currently not being implemented in demo of product. 

* Accomplishment: Implementation of projectile motion physics being applied to collidable bodies. The creation of this allows for a more realistic engagement during game-play, as we will see the projectile simulating the affects of gravity. Link to this can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s21romulans/romulans-tank-game-repository/src/master/Game/Script/bullet.gd)
![exampleGif](ReadMePhotos/shoot.gif).
*(Please note, not all game-play mechanics in picture are implemented as of completion of first sprint.)*

## Moving Forward
Due to the end of the semester, there no school sanctioned goal on moving forward. we as a group do hope to continue this project as a group if possible, or work on another project together for use of professional development. 

We hope for more to come, so stay tuned!
